# Descriptive Analysis of Demographic Data (2003-2023)

## Overview
This project analyzes demographic data from the **U.S. Census Bureau's International Data Base (IDB)** for the years 2003 and 2023. The study focuses on:
- **Median Age** (stratified by gender and region),
- **Infant Mortality Rates**, and
- **Total Fertility Rates**.

The project involves data preprocessing, statistical analysis, and visualization to uncover insights into global demographic patterns and their changes over the two decades.

   - Stratify data by gender and geographic regions.
2. **Comparative Analysis**:
   - Analyze the homogeneity and heterogeneity within and between European and African subregions.
   - Compare demographic variables between 2003 and 2023 to highlight temporal trends.
3. **Correlation Analysis**:
   - Investigate relationships between variables, such as **Median Age** and **Infant Mortality Rate**.
